            Cheesecake is a sweet dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta),
            eggs, and sugar. It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry,
            or sometimes sponge cake. Cheesecake may be baked or unbaked, and is usually refrigerated.
            
            Vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors may be added to the main cheese layer. Additional flavors
            and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished dessert with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce,
            chocolate syrup, or other ingredients.
